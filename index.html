                <h2>Friday</h2>
                <h3>New PC Day</h3>
                <p>Finished my <em>first</em> ever PC build at 4am. It was stressful and rewarding. Stressful because I was making my first attempt at something and was worried about damaging the expensive equipment, and also was so pumped to get it done that I was pretty sure I would end up behind in classwork because of it. Rewarding when I booted it up and played my first round of Rocket League.</p>

                    <h3>House to myself</h3>
                </div>
                <p>Had the apartment to myself today. Played more games, namely: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b><span style="color:blue">Rocket League</span></b>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <b><span style="color:red">Fortnite</span></b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                <p>until midnight. Enjoyed being loud at night with no one to worry about waking up.</p>

                    <p>Missed Gana once my friend went to bed and I was home alone at midnight.</p>

                <h2>Sunday</h2>
                <h3>Social Day</h3>
                <p>Four main highlights for today</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Went to church with friends today
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Ate some home cooked fish curry with them afterward
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Wanted to get started on this assignment before it was too late, then another friend called and shared an idea for a project. Autonomous robot that picks up tennis balls for tennis players. <br>(Might be doing this. Would be a good way to get experience with the  <a href="https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/dragonboard-410c">dragonboard</a>)
                    </li>

                    <li>
